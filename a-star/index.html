    <A HREF="index1.html">Stage 0; perlin works, pathing works... think it cheats and doesn't find a 'best'; continues with backscan after completion (fast complete) </A><BR>
    <A HREF="index2.html">Stage 1; path is by slope; going up is harder than going down... does a wide scan; h1() is too short </A><BR>
    <A HREF="index3.html">Stage 2; path is by height; it prefers to take the lowest path available. (started tracking known 'paths') </A><BR>
    <A HREF="index4.html">Stage 3; Path is by slope. black->blue->red->white is height, and prefer least 'up' path.</A><BR>
    <A HREF="index5.html">Stage 4; Natural ladscape textures - find A*path across flattest median</A> - min and max limit the path...to make it effecitvley untraversable... could get locked and not draw a path... please refresh- it doesn't know how far it got either to try again(?)<BR>
